# This is an example note
I want to test how this thing works. Also, I want to get an eye on the internal files it creates.

First at all, I want to make an assumtion on [[How does it works]], and try to guess how is it built.

After that, I will make a little bit of research. The full explanation of the research is in the page [[What will I do?]]

As soon as I discover stuff, I will keep track on it, and explain it in the folder `research` under the note [[research/How does it works]]
