# How (actually) works

Well, I was way wrong. It scans every file, looks for the references, and match them with the file structure. Interesting.

The thing that mostly surprise me is the [[How does it works#^example-name]] graph part:

I don't see any index, so I guess it has created some internal temp dir on my computer, and added that index there. Gotta find it.

Go back to the [[Home note]].
